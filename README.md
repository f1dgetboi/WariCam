# About WariCam
## Overview:
Waricam is a app developed for splitting the bill between people by how much they ate so the bill gets split fairly.This project is a Hackathon project made in 2 weeks wich was updated a little bit afterwards.
## About the future of this project:   

・I want to add support for more food   
・Make it so you can setup the app from a excel file and it gives and report about what    was orderd and how much left over there were etc...   
・Update the UI as the UI is made with pygame and is slow so I want to make my own library with vulkan or something
